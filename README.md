# RE-MAT Clowder Extractors
Data Management for the RE-MAT project is using NCSA's [Clowder data management
framework](https://clowderframework.org) to store and discover experiment data.

Clowder uses extractors to inspect attached files and create metadata and
derive files. This repository hosts the extractors developed for the project.
